# Introduction to Testing

## Possible outcomes of testing

- True Pass
- True Reject
- Test Escapes (Under testing)
- Yield Loss (Over Testing)

## Testing Philosophy

Electronic testing also uses fault modeling and tests are generated for the  assumed fault models

## VLSI Trends

- Test complexity
- Feature scaling and power dissipation
    - Verification testing must check for power buses overloaded  by excessive current
    - Application of the test vectors may cause excessive power  dissipation on the chip and burn it out
    - Shrinking features will eventually require the design of  transistors with reduced threshold voltage

# Single Stuck at Fault

- We assume Circuit is modelled as interconnection (netlist) and faults only affect the interconnection between gates
- Each line can have 2 types of faults (sa0, sa1)
- For the sake simplicity, we assume only single SaFs to be present in a circuit at a time
- Properties/ Assumptions:
    - Only 1 line is faulty
    - Faulty lines is permanently set to 0/1
    - Fault can be at the input/output of a gate

# Fault Equivalence

- When 2 circuits have the same test vectors, both tests are indistinguishable/ equivalent
- Two faults of a Boolean circuit are called equivalent  if they transform the circuit such that the two faulty circuits have  identical output functions. Equivalent faults are also called  indistinguishable and have exactly the same set of tests.
- Common ckts and FEs:
    - AND - sa0
    - OR - sa1
    - NAND - sa0 (input), sa1 (output)
    - NOR - sa1 (input), sa0 (output)


# Fault Collapse

- Selecting one of the equivalent faults from each other is fault collapse
- Collapse Ratio = frac{set of collapsed faults}{set of all faults}
    - Where set of selected faults is known as the equivalence collapsed set 

# Fault Dominance

- If all tests of some fault F1 detect another fault F2, then F2 is said to dominate F1
- If fault F2 dominates F1, then F2 is removed from the fault list


# Checkpoint Theorem

- Primary	inputs	and	fanout	branches	of	a
  combinational	circuit	are	called	the	checkpoints
- A test set that detects all single stuck-at faults of the checkpoints of a  combinational circuit detects all single stuck-at faults in that circuit


# Fault Modelling

## Functional vs Structural Testing

- Complete functional test will check each entry of the truth table
- Hardware test (also referred to as manufacturing test) is to discover any faults caused due to manufacturing defects or errors


## Glossary of Fault Models

### Assertion Fault

An assertion fault means that the corresponding property is not “true” for some input of the system.

### Behavioral Faults

Behavioral faults refer to incorrect execution of the language constructs  used in the description

### Branch Fault

Branch fault affects a branch statement and causes it to branch to an incorrect destination

### Bridging Fault

Bridging fault  represents a short between a group of signals

### Bus Fault:

A bus fault specifies the status for each line in a bus as stuck-at-0,  stuck-at-1, or fault-free

### Cross-point Fault

- **Missing cross-point** means a missing connection at a crossing where a  connection was intended.
- **Extra cross-point** means a faulty connection at a crossing where no  connection was intended.

### Defect-Oriented Faults

The electrical or logic-level faults that can be produced by physical  defects are classified as defect-oriented faults

### Delay Fault:

These faults cause the combinational delay of a circuit to exceed the clock period.

### Gate-Delay Fault:

The fault increases the input to output delay of a single logic gate, while all other gates retain some nominal values of delay

### Hyperactive Fault

Hyperactive fault causes a large number of signals in the circuit to  differ from their correct values

### Initialization Fault

Faults that interfere with initialization of memory like elements are called initialization faults

### Instruction Fault

An instruction fault causes an intended instruction to be incorrectly executed

### Intermittent Fault

A fault that appears and disappears as a function of time is called an  intermittent fault

### Line-Delay Fault

This fault models rising and falling delays of a given signal line

### Logical Faults


### Memory Faults


### Multiple Fault


### Non-classical Fault


### Oscillation Fault


### Parameteric Fault


### Path Delay Fault


### Pattern Sensitive Fault


### Permanent Fault


### Physical Fault


### Pin Fault


### PLA Fault

- Stuck-at faults on inputs and outputs.
- Cross-point faults
- Bridging faults


# Automatic Test Pattern Generator

ATPG algorithms inject a fault into a circuit, and then use a variety of  mechanisms to activate the fault and cause its effect to propagate  through the hardware and manifest itself at a circuit output

# Scan Design

Inserting special purpose muxes and clocking hardware to every flip flop for testing

# Algebra

- Roth's
- Muth's

# ATPG Algorithms

## Exhaustive 


## Random – Used With Algorithmic Methods 


## Deterministic ARPG techniques

### Symbolic Boolean Difference


### Path Sensitization

- Fault sensitization
- Fault propagation
- Line justification

# Redundancy Identification

We only consider hardware that is untestable for stuck-faults to be redundant

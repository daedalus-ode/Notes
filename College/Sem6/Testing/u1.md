# Introduction
## Classifications
- Key -> Symmetric & Asymmetric
- Process -> Stream (Cipher) & Block (AES, DES)
- Methods -> Transposition & Substitution

## Goals
- C - Confidentiality
- I - Integrity
- A - Availability

## Attacks
- Confidentiality
  - Snooping (P)
    - Eavsdropping on the messages between 2 parties but not affecting the message itself
  - Traffic Analysis (P)
    - Analysis on the frequency of the characters/packets that are occur in the message and compare it to the frequency of commonly occurring characters (Ex: )
- Integrity
  - Modification (A)
    - Modification to the message when its enroute to destination
  - Masquerading (A)
    - Acting as the intended source/destination to hijack the connection 
  - Replaying (A)
    - Using packets intercepted by the attacker from the source and replaying it later
  - Repudiation (A)
    - When a conversation/ transfer takes place but one/ both parties does not acknowledge it ever happening (involves manipulation in logs)
- Availability
  - Denial Of Service (A)
    - Over flodding a server with so many requests such that clients cannot access the server

> [!NOTE]
> A - Active
>   - Alteration to the message
>   - Hard to detect
>   - Easy to prevent
> P - Passive
>   - No alteration to the message
>   - Easy to detect
>   - Hard to prevent

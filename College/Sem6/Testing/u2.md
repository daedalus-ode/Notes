# Definitions

## Singular Cover

- Minimal set of input signal assignments needed to represent essential prime implicants of a KMAP

## D Frontier

- Comprises of gates whose output value is X and atleast 1 of its i/p is D or overline{D}
- Any gate in D frontier can be used for fault propagation

## Unique D Drive

- If there is one 1 gate is D frontier, fault effect has to be propagated through that gate

## J Frontier

- Gates whose output value is known (0 or 1) but its inputs are not yet computed
- Any gate in J frontier can be used for justification

# D Algorithm

## Procedure

1. Unique D Drive
2. Backward Implication
3. Propagate D Through D frontier
4. Backward Implication

## PDFC (Primitive D Cube for a Fault)

Specify minimal input conditions
    - Applied to gate input to produce error at the gate output
    - Used in fault activation


## PDC (Propagation D Cube)


## TC (Test Cube)

Test cube is a partially specified Boolean values for testing a fault

## Pros

- Guarantee to generate a pattern for the testable fault

## Cons

- Assignment of values is allowed for internal signals
- Backtracking could occur at each gate
- Very large search space


# PODEM (Path Oriented Decision Making Algorithm)

## What it is

PODEM choose what input to be chosen based on difficulty level as given by the controllability measures.


## SCOAP (Sandia Controllability Observability Analysis Program)

### CC (Combinational Controllability)

- CC1 - The controllability to assert 1 at a net
- CC0 - The controllability to assert 0 at a net

### CO (Combinational Observability)

- CO(a) - The observability of an input (a) as seen from the output


# Sequential Circuit Testing

## Procedure

1. Initialisation of FFs
2. Activating of fault
3. Propagation of fault

## Algebra

### Roth's Algebra (5 Values)

- Initial algebra for testing out circuits with five values
- Possible Values - 1 (`1/1`), 0 (`0/0`), D (`1/0`), D <sup>~</sup> (`0/1`), X (`X/X`)

### Muth's Algebra (9 Values)

- Roth's 5 valued algebra was insufficient for testing sequential circuits
- Added these values :- G0 (`0/x`), G1(`1/X`), F0(`X/0`), F1(`X/1`)

## Types of Sequential ATPG ckts

- Cyclic Circuit
- Acyclic Circuit


# Simplified Model

## Assumptions

- Single SaFs
- FFs are treated as ideal memory elements
    - Internal faults in FFs are not modeled
    - Faults in clk signal are ignored
    - only i/p and o/p of FFs are considered

## Time Frame Expansion

- Unroll the ckt with respect to each time frame (each posedge of the clock)
- Efficient for acyclic circuits

## Simulation Based Methods

- Use vector spaces to find all the test vectors iteratively
- Algorithms:
    - Contest
    - Genetic

# Contest Algorithm

## Intro

- Concurrent test generator
- Search for test is guided by cost functions

## Phases

- Initialisation - Compute Cost functions
- Concurrent Phase
- Single fault phase

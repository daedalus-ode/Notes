## 6th optimisation
> [!NOTE]
> Assume that 64kB 4 way set associative L1 data cache has access time 2 cycles with miss rate of 3.3% in system. As an alternative cache organisation you are considering a way predicted cache modified as a 64 KB DM cache with 80% prediction accuracy. The DM cache has access time of 1 cycle and miss rate of 5.5%. Assume that a mispredicted way access that hits in cache takes one more cycle. Assume miss penalty as 10 cycles. What is the avg memory access time of the way predicted cache?

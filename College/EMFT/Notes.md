# Vector multiplication
1. Scalar (dot) product $A \cdot B\ =\ A\ B\ cos\theta_{AB}$
2. Vector (cross) product $A \times B\ =\ A\ B\ sin\theta_{AB}\ \hat{a_n}$
3. Scalar triple product $A \cdot (B \times C)\ =\ B \cdot (C \times A)\ =\ C \cdot (A \times B)$
4. Vector triple product $A \times (B \times C)\ =\ B(A\cdot C) - C(A\cdot B)$
# Coordinate system and transformation
## Cartesian 
- Consists of x, y and z coordinates which range from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ to depict the location
- $(A_x,\ A_y,\ A_z) = A_x a_x + A_y a_y + A_z a_z$
## Circular cylindrical
- A point is represented in terms of $(\rho, \phi, z)$
- $\rho$ ->  the radial distance from z-axis to point
- $\phi$ -> azimuthal angle of point measure from x-axis on xy-plane
- $z$ -> distance of point from xy-plane
- $x = \rho cos\theta \ ,\ y = \rho \sin\theta \ ,\ z=z$

## Spherical
- Denoted by $(r,\ \theta,\ \phi)$
- $r$ -> distance between origin and point
- $\theta$ -> colatitude, angle between z-axis and position vector
- $\phi$ -> azimuthal angle, measure between x axis and position vector
- $x = rsin\theta cos\phi\ ,\ y = rsin\theta sin\phi\ ,\ z = rcos\theta$

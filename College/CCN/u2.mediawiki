== TCP ==
* Transmission control protocol
* Principles of reliable data transfer
** Packet loss reasons
*** Corrupt packet dropped by reciever
*** Packet drop at router due to lack of buffer space
*** Long queuing delays in the router
** Reliable data transfer
*** Requires connection oriented approach
*** Throughput and delay may be compromised
** 


* Predecessors
** RDT protocol
*** Stop and wait RDT protocol
**** RDT 1.0
***** Assumes no bit errors and no packet delays
***** Solution: Works on the principle of acknowledgement
***** Next packet is sent after the acknowledgment
**** RDT 2.0
***** Bit errors can occure only in the packet transmitted
***** No packet delays assumed
***** Solution: Introduction of checksum
***** If checksum corrupt, send back NAK packet
***** Else send back ACK
**** RDT 2.2
***** Bit error can occur both ways
***** Assume no packet delays
***** Difficult to distinguish between old and new packets
***** ACK and NAK can also get corrupted
***** Solution: Sequence numbers (use 0 and 1 alternatively) and checksum
***** Host B just uses ACK packets with sequence (0 or 1)
**** RDT 4.0
***** Bit errors and packet delays occur in 2 way packet transmission
***** Solution: Host A starts a timer as soon as packet is transmitted
***** If ACK packet from host B is lost/old/corrupt host host A retransmits after timer expires
***** Else host A sends next packet and restart timer
*** Pipelining RDT protocols - better link utilization
**** GBN
**** SR
** TCP
*** Hybrid of above RDT protocol with some additions
*** More robust
*** Adaptive to network congestion

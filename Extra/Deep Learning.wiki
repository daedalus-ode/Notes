= Machine learning =
* Training
** Creating the model/weights
** Typically done on GPUs
* Inferencing
** Almost any device like MCU, CPU, SoC, FPGA

== Tasks ==
* Classification
* Regression
* Clustering
* Anamoly detection
* Dimensionality reduction

= Deep Learning =
* A subset of Machine learning in which more than 1 layer of neurons are used
* Perfect for detecting hidden relations between data in large data sets
* Types
** Supervised Learning
** Contains labels that are used for training the model
* Kinds
** ANN - Artificial NN
** CNN - Convulation NN
*** Good for Image processing
** R-CNN - Regional CNN
*** Good for Object detection
** RNN - Recurrent NN
*** Good for NLP
	  
= Neuron =
Parts
* Linear function of weighted sum and a constant bias
* Non-linear activation function
** ReLU
** ReLU6
** Leaky ReLU
** Logistic/ Sigmoid

= CNN =
* Based on the principle of convolving a convolution filter/kernel with the input layer
* The output of 1 layer of convultion is a feature map

= Open Source Training Frameworks =
* Caffe
* Caffe2
* TensorFlow
* Cognitive toolbox
* Torch/ Pytorch
* Mxnet
* theano
* Keras

= Edge Computing Tool Flow =
* Training - Caffe, Tensorflow, etc
* Format Conversion 
** Convert trained weights into vendor specifications
* Weight footprint management (Limited memory on edge)
** Pruning
*** setting near-zero weights to zero
*** Very less loss in accuracy of model
*** Can be retrained using the sparse weights to give better accuracy
** Quantisation
*** replacing 32 floats weights to 8 bit integers
** Compression
*** Storing sparse weight matrix in compressed format
* Engine specific optimisations
** Operation fusing
** Memory optimisation

= Advantages of FPGAs =
* High throughput and low latency vs CPU/GPU
* Can accelerate performance critical functions, not just AI
* Can update the architecture

= Vitis AI =
* Frameworks - TF, Caffe, Pytorch
* Development Kit
** Optimiser
*** Performs Pruning (FP32 -> FP32)
** Quantiser
*** Quantisation (FP32 -> INT8)
** Compiler
*** Optimise for FPGAs
** Library
*** Inference Engine, AI runtime, DPU (Deep Learning PU)
** Profiler
